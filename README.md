# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a dynamic recommendation system for movies using collaborative filtering techniques. It is designed to demonstrate key data science and machine learning skills, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building.

## Features
- Collaborative filtering for personalized movie recommendations.
- Utilizes cosine similarity to measure relationships between movies and users.
- Scalable design with modular scripts for easier integration and expansion.
